# Making the decision to purchase – How to visualise value


### Why I want to purchase visualise value course? 

-   WordPress sites are only as good as the theme is 
-   I only have good taste. I can tell good from bad. Not able to convert taste into real world stuff
-   Spend hours trying to find the best theme and it still falls short
-   The price will increase – I will not be able to afford it then

### Where will I put this in practice

For the next 3 months I will be focusing on building [Mr Albert](http://mralbert.in/) (gst filing service for self employed indians) and [Asyncauto](https://www.asyncauto.com/) ( a specialised dev shop). I will use the learning from this and try and improved the messaging on these.

**For Mr Albert I have a recurring revenue of**

and for Asyncauto I have one active client.

**Landing page for Mr Albert looks like this:**

**Landing page for Asyncauto looks like this:**

### Outcome I would like to have with this course:

The landing pages above look sort of ok. If I am able to polish these and additionally bring in significant more revenue, then this will be worth it. Hopefully I can show some output in 3 months time.

### Bet that I am taking:

-   Little risky because since I quit my job, I am eating into my savings
-   Checked out the twitter 
-   Tons of review on twitter from people – maybe it is good. 
-   Watched this video – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsuULV4XtTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsuULV4XtTs)
-   What kind of content should you be making. – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snb7aPXvSUA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snb7aPXvSUA)
-   Asked on twitter if there is a discount. They might not give one.. but I need get used to asking.
