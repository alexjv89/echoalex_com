# I dont have time

Fill a garage with small stuff on the floor and you will be left with no space to park you car. 

You are left wondering why you never have space in your garage. 

Space in your garage is not the problem. What and how you are filling the space is the the problem.

Fill you time with 5 min activities such as youtube shorts and you wonder why you dont have time for meaningful activities that needs 1-2 hrs. If you never have time, then its because you have gap fillers filling up your entire time. Your gap fillers are the problem.
