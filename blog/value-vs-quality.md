# Value vs Quality

Value and quality dont have a linear relationship. The equation is non-linear. It looks something like this:

If you are positioning your service as a premium service, then a small drop in quality will result in a large drop in value. In the example able 10% drop in quality results in 50% drop in value. 

The last 10% of quality is where 50% of value is generated for the customer. 

People dont get annoyed when the AC in Tata Indica does not work. But you will get furious when the AC in Mercedes does not work. 

This is why if you are selling premium products, reliability matters. One mistake is enough to loose a lot of value. 

If you want to charge high, then your reliability and quality expectations needs to be high.
