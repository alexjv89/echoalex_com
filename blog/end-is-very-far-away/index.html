<h1>If you don't know the end, then you need to assume the end is very far away</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<ul>
<li>When working on a new project, when you are trying to polish and finish the project, you might think that - &quot;do these 3 things and the project is done&quot;.</li>
<li>Very often when you do those 3 things you will discover that there are 3 more things to do.</li>
<li>When you do this next 3 things, you will discover that there are 5 more things to do.</li>
<li>This spoils your project plan. Your work never gets done. You get discouraged. Customer is always unhappy with your product</li>
</ul>
<h2>The right mentality</h2>
<ul>
<li>For these kinds of things, always assume the end is very far way.</li>
<li>Race though what you have visibility into.</li>
<li>Race though the things that you newly discovered that needs to be done.</li>
<li>Once fine day, you will actually be done while you are still thinking there is a lot more to be done.</li>
<li>That will give you a sense of accomplishment when you finally realize that the project is actually done.</li>
</ul>
