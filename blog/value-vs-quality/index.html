<h1>Value vs Quality</h1>
<p>Value and quality dont have a linear relationship. The equation is non-linear. It looks something like this:

<p>If you are positioning your service as a premium service, then a small drop in quality will result in a large drop in value. In the example 10% drop in quality results in 50% drop in value.</p>
<p>The last 10% of quality is where 50% of value is generated for the customer.</p>
<p>People dont get annoyed when the AC in Tata Indica does not work. But you will get furious when the AC in Mercedes does not work.</p>
<p>This is why if you are selling premium products, reliability matters. One mistake is enough to loose a lot of value.</p>
<p>If you want to charge high, then your reliability and quality expectations needs to be high.</p>
