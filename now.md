# What I am doing now

Context: Seeing [Derek Sivers’ now page](https://sivers.org/now), I am inspired to create one myself. This is my now page. [Learn more now pages](https://nownownow.com/about).

I have been planning to work on something of my own for a long time. I love to make things – make electronics, make software, make products, make companies etc. For the last 4 years and 3 months, I have been working with [Ather](https://www.atherenergy.com/) as head of business software. My original plan was to work at Ather for 6 months and start something, but then life happened and 6 months plan become 4 year plan.

End of march 2020, my gig with Ather is finally done and I am planning to work on a bunch of things. These are the things that I am most excited to work on:

-   [mralbert](https://www.mralbert.in/) – A GST filing service for freelancers and consultants (only in India)
-   [cashflowy](https://github.com/asyncauto/cashflowy) – An open source accounting software for small business owners 
-   [switchless.io](http://switchless.io/) – An open source tech stack that helps reduce your switching cost.
-   [asyncauto](https://www.asyncauto.com/) – A specialised software consulting dev shop. 
-   [highlyreco](https://www.highlyreco.com/) – Recommendations from people you look up to.

### A pinch of self doubt

I do have a good amount of self doubt. Will I be successful in atleast one of these products? Will I make enough money to survive, if not thrive? Will I have to go back to a regular job. Timing is also something that I am slightly bothered by. I quit job at a time when markets are not doing well due to the corona situation.

**Here is how I mitigate my self doubt:**

-   I am reasonably skilled.
-   I have enough money saved up to last me a year
-   I really enjoy working on my own/I hate working in a large company. I really really don’t want to go back and get a job.
